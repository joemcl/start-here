# techforwarren/start-here

Welcome! This GitHub organization is run by a volunteer group of technologists who are mobilizing their skills to help Elizabeth Warren clinch the nomination and win in 2020. Our mission is to build tools, apps, websites, infrastructure, and any technologies that will engage grassroots supporters and empower our movement.

## How to Join

Our group is organized through the [All in for Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/all-in-for-warren/) digital community. [Applying with this link](https://community.elizabethwarren.com/registrations/groups/33907) will initiate the onboarding process and notify moderators of your specific interest in joining the (Let's Build) Tech for Warren group. Note that there are many other community groups you can follow based on geography, identity, and interest, and you can sign up for as many as you like.

## How to Promote

As our digital projects turn into shareable products, we could use your help in making them visible to Warren supporters and potential Democratic Primary voters. We encourage you to share public-facing links to projects that are "in production" with your own social networks. If you are active on other All-In groups, post there. If you are active on social media, share with your followers. If you organize locally, make your fellow volunteers aware of tools and content we're creating — and come back to us with their suggestions and use cases! **A project you can promote right now is the [Event Map](https://techforwarren.github.io/eventmap/).**

## How to Contribute

If you are looking for a place to start, **take a look below at our list of active projects**, which are in various states of development. Whatever your skillset, there are many ways to contribute. Some of our current needs include: responding to developer requests for help in implementing specific features, testing and debugging prototypes, suggesting/providing UX enhancements (like improved accessibility), and supporting team efforts as a project maintainer. Take a look at the issues in project repos to see where help is needed on specific projects.

New project ideas will be fielded by this organization's maintainers and passed along to others in the volunteer community for feedback and consideration. To be actively supported by the volunteer community, a project must (at minimum) establish a clear goal, identify some relevant tools and frameworks, and demonstrate commitment by an individual or team to see the project through.

Contributors are expected to adhere to our [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct).
